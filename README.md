# Kuebiko
The aim of the project is to create an inclusive Novel reading and writing software in which readers can read through a wide variety of novels of different genres and is available in different languages and also, writers can exhibit their writing skills and upload their own work for others to read and get recognised through the website.

# About 
This website will act as a platform for the writers to showcase their creativity and the language will not be limited to just English. Currently people who cannot enjoy their local novels due to inaccessibility or unavailability. The users will be able to get content
from their favorite authors.
The TTS (Text to Speech) feature can also be used by the readers who have visual imparity. This also helps in providing the users with the hands-free feature so they can enjoy while doing their other work simultaneously.

# Limitations
The current model of the website doesnâ€™t have any module that allows the user to interact with other users other than the comment section. Also there is no feature to show appreciation to the authors by contributing money to help them have a better livelihood.

# Scope 
We would like to implement a module which enables users to interact among themselves as the only interaction is through the comment section. We would also like to include a feature that lets users show appreciation to the authors by donating money. This will motivate the authors to write more and improve their content for better feedback.
